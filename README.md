# Graphview

*A simple app to rotate full-screen graphs on a systems monitoring display*

Inspired by [CactiView](https://github.com/lozzd/cactiview), Graphview
runs entirely in the browser, and provides graph image preloading to
avoid progressive loading annoyance on slow connections.

Supports displaying graphs from Cacti and Graphite, iframes (like New
Relic), Jenkins build status (currently poorly styled), as well showing the time.

## Usage

Graphview needs to be served from a webserver to work.

Check out example-config.json for how to configure. It will try and load `config.json` by
default; you can override using `?config=filename.json`.
